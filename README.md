This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch
